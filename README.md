Project Title: Global Malaria Impact

Tools Used: SQL & Excel

**Project Overview**

This project analyzed global malaria cases, deaths, and fatality rates across countries and regions. The primary objective was to transform raw malaria data into actionable insights by analyzing cases, deaths, and fatality rates across time and geography, and presenting findings through intuitive dashboards.

**Methodology**

Raw malaria data was cleaned and standardized using SQL. Numeric values embedded in text fields were extracted, missing values were handled appropriately, and an analysis ready dataset was created. A fatality rate metric was derived using deaths and cases, with undefined values preserved as NULL to maintain analytical accuracy. Over 25 SQL queries were used to conduct descriptive, trend, and comparative analyses.

**Dataset Description**

•	Countries: 107

•	Records: 856

•	Key Fields: Country, Year, Cases, Deaths, WHO Region

**Dashboard Structure**

The analysis is presented through three dashboards:

•	Overview Dashboard - Provides details of global malaria burden.

•	Analysis Dashboard - Provides the breakdown of the malaria data.

•	Trends Dashboard - Examines changes in cases and deaths over time.

**Key Findings**

•	Malaria burden is highly concentrated.

•	Africa bears the highest malaria burden while Europe has the lowest burden.

•	Fatality rates vary significantly across regions.

•	Decline in cases do no always translate to decline in deaths.

•	Nigeria has the highest cases and deaths.

•	Morocco has the highest fatality rate.
